In 4.0 :ref:`configure_announcements` now have the ability to be ``dismissable``.
Meaning users can press ``OK`` on the announment and it will no longer appear
on the pages.

In prior versions of Open OnDemand there was no way to dismiss or get rid of announcements.
Now in version 4.0, not only is there a way to dismiss announcements, announcements

The documentation for :ref:`configure_announcements` has been updated with this new feature.
